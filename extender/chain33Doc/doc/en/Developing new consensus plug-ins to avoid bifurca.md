When developing new consensus protocol, if you don't want to make the chain splitNote that in the CreateBlock() implementation of the Miner interface, a consensus node calls client.writeblock() to initiate the packaging of the new block. If more than one node packages a new block at the same height, fork occurs. Only the longest chain retained at last, and the fork chain will be cleaned up, the forked transaction data on the chain will return to the mempool, waiting for the new block to package it.
